Echoes is an anonymous social media platform that enables users to share their thoughts, secrets, questions, and confessions freely without disclosing their identity. It facilitates a unique interactive environment through features like publishing anonymous posts ("echoes"), commenting on these posts ("resonating"), and a special feature termed the "Echo Chamber" where users can revisit all the public echoes.
